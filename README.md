# Removable Media Control using PowerShell script.

__Disclaimer:__ I didnâ€™t re-invent the wheel, I built this script on top of the removable media listner that I found in some comment while googling long time ago, and I wish I can find it again so I can give this man credit.

## Business case:

1. Few USBs are allowed to be used within our network and should not be used outside.   
2. No other USBs can be used within our network.     

## Business needs:

1.	USBs should be encrypted using BitLocker by the IT/any other team.    
2.	This team only knows the password.    
3.	USBs to be distributed to the required teams/personnel   
4.	All our encrypted USBs should auto-unlock if inserted in our network.   
5.	All un-encrypted USBs should be eject automatically.   
6.	All any other encrypted USBs with different passwords should be ejected automatically.    
7.  Windows Event is logged.
